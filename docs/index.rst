Neutrino Physics
==============================

Neutrino is one of the most interesting particles in our world. The first proposal of such a new particle was given by Pauli. He managed to explain the spectrum of beta decay. In 1956, neutrinos were first detected in Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment. [1]_ Later on a lot of neutrino experiments have been carried out.
