Collective Behavior
=================

In a dense neutrino environment, neutrino oscillations could exhibit collective behaviors or synchronized behaviors.


An example of this is the case of dense neutrino gas. The total flavour isospin could precess around effective hamiltonian like the precession of gyroscope with all the indvidual flavour isospin precess around the total flavour isospin.
