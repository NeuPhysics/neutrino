Collective Behavior
=================

In a dense neutrino environment, neutrino oscillations could exhibit collective behaviors or synchronized behaviors.







Equation of Motion in Matter
--------------------------------------



The effect of matter, as we have already discussed before, adds an extra term

.. math::
   H_m = \sqrt{2}G_F n_e L.

In the most simple case, :math:`L=\frac{1}{2}\sigma_3`. This will cause MSW effect.


One other term is the self-interaction of neutrinos, i.e., neutral-current neutrino-neutrino forward exchange scattering,

.. math::
   H_\nu =\sqrt{2}G_F \int d^3\mathbf p' (1-\hat {\mathbf p}\cdot \hat{\mathbf p}')(\rho_{p'}-\bar \rho_{p'}).


The overall Hamiltonian is

.. math::
   H = H_0 + H_m + H_\nu ,

where the vacuum Hamiltonian is

.. math::
   H_0 &= \frac{\delta^2 m}{2E} B \\
   & = \frac{\delta^2 m}{2E} U \left(\frac{1}{2}\sigma_3 \right) U^\dagger .



In `Picture <.picture.html>`_ chapter we have seen the definition of a polarization matrix, which is

.. math::
   \mathbf \rho = 





Bipolar Model
-----------------------

.. figure:: assets/bipolar.png

The neutrinos are generated in two classes with the same number density thus making up two total flavour isospins.








Dense Homogeneous Isotropic Neutrino Gas
----------------------------------------------------------

The total flavour isospin could precess around effective hamiltonian like the precession of gyroscope with all the indvidual flavour isospin precess around the total flavour isospin.
