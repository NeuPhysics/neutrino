Preliminary
===========

This chapter is about the preliminary knowledge required by this topic.


Reactions Related to Neutrinos
-----------------------------------------


1. Beta decays, :math:`n\to p + e^- +\bar \nu` and :math:`p\to n + e^+ +\nu`
2. Electron capture and positron capture, :math:`e^- + p\to n+\nu` and :math:`e^+ + n \to p + \bar \nu`.
3. Inverse beta decays, :math:`\nu+ n \to p+e^-` and :math:`\bar\nu + p \to n + e^+`.
4. Inverses of beta decays, :math:`\bar\nu + e^- + p \to n` and :math:`n+e^++\nu \to n`.


What is a Neutrino Particle?
-------------------------------------


As Wigner said, a physical particle is an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. A characteristic of Poincaré group is that mass comes in.

A neutrino particle is better recognized as its mass eigenstate.

In QFT, there are 3 different forms of neutrino mass term, left-handed Majorana, right-handed Majorana and Dirac mass terms.









Chirality and Helicity
-----------------------------

Helicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Helicity** is the projection of spin onto direction of momentum,

.. math::
   h = \vec J\cdot\hat p = \vec L\cdot\hat p + \vec S\cdot \hat p = \vec S\cdot \hat p,

where

.. math::
   \hat p = \frac{\vec p}{\left|\vec p\right|}


A state is called **right-handed** if helicity is positive, i.e., spin has the same direction as momentum.


Chirality
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Chirality** is the eigenstate of the Dirac :math:`\gamma_5` matrix, which is explicitly,

.. math::
   \gamma^5 &= \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf 0 & \mathbf I \\ \mathbf I & \mathbf 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
   & = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \end{pmatrix}.
