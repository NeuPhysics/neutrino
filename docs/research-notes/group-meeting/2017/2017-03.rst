Topic: Dispersion Relation of Neutrino Flavor Oscillations

About numerical calculations

1. My :math:`\omega` and :math:`k` have a minus sign compared to Raffelts result.
2. Not exactly the same plot. How can I determine the scaling of spectrum. In principle I have the same definition of :math:`G`. However, it definitely is not the case when comparing the result.


About analytical analysis

1. I should have the discrete case approaching the continuous case when the number of beams becomes large.

1. Solved the continuous case but the result is weird, both for homogeneous and nonhonogeous case.
