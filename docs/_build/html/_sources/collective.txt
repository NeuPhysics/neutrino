Collective Behavior
=================

In a dense neutrino environment, neutrino oscillations could exhibit collective behaviors or synchronized behaviors.






Bipolar Model
-----------------------

The neutrinos are generated in two classes with the same number density thus making up two total flavour isospins.



Dense Homogeneous Isotropic Neutrino Gas
----------------------------------------------------------

The total flavour isospin could precess around effective hamiltonian like the precession of gyroscope with all the indvidual flavour isospin precess around the total flavour isospin.
