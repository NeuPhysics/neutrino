Questions
--------------------




Here are some great questions about neutrinos.


.. admonition:: Origin of Masses
   :class: warning

   The exact mechanism of neutrino mass

.. admonition:: Majorana or Dirac
   :class: warning

   Is neutrino its own antiparticle? Or is neutrino Majorana or Dirac?


.. admonition:: Mass Hierarchy
   :class: warning

   What's the mass hierarchy?

   We know from solar neutrino experiments that :math:`m_1^2 < m_2^2` using the theory of MSW effect since MSW only happens for :math:`m_2^2-m_1^2>0`. (Just like some kind of definition in fact.)

   On the other hand, we don't know the ordering of :math:`m_3` with respect to the other two. Since :math:`\lvert m_3^2 - m_1^2 \rvert \gg m_2^2 - m_1^2`, we could only have two ordering, :math:`m_1^2<m_2^2<m_2^2` or :math:`m_3^2<m_1^2<m_3^2`.




.. admonition:: Mixing Angles
   :class: warning

   What are the mixing angles?



.. admonition:: Families
   :class: warning

   How many different flavours of neutrinos are there? Are there any sterile neutrinos?


.. admonition:: CP Violation
   :class: warning

   CP Violation etc
