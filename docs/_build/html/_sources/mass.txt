=====================



Neutrino masses are still not determined completely. However we have some possible patterns.

One of the questions we have about the masses of neutrinos is **the generation of it**.


.. note::
   This figure also gives the terms: normal hierarchy (NH) and invertd hierarchy (IH).


See-saw Mechanism
------------------

RH neutrinos term in Lagrangian breaks the symmetry.
