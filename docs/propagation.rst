   How to interpret neutrino propagation and scattering using wave packet formalism?




In the book of *Principles of Quantum Mechanics*, Shankar shows how to deal with scattering using just wave packet.

What I can do is to check the following questions.

1. How do wave packet formalism help us understanding the scattering of neutrinos.
2. How do relativistic case change the results?
3. What if the packet is a combination of Gaussian packets?
