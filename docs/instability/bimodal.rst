Bimodal Oscillations
=========================



Bimodal in this context means :highlight-text:`two frequencies` [Samuel1996]_. With neutrino coherent scattering, the neutrino state consists of two frequencies.

An example of such intability happens in a system composed of equal amounts of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Flavour transform occurs due to

.. math::
   \nu_e + \bar{\nu_e} \leftrightarrow \nu_x + \bar{\nu_x}.

Vacuum mixing angle triggers the flavour instability.


Neutrino oscillations has a small amplitude inside a SN core (suppressed by matter effects) [Wolfenstein1978]_, which basically pins down the flavour transformation. As the neutrinos reaches a furthur distance, matter effect could drop out. Neutrino self-interaction becomes more important. [Samuel1996]_ considers a system of neutrinos and antineutrinos with only vacuum and neutrino self-interactions. The neutrinos and antineutrino forms a bipolar vector in flavor isospin space. The flavor isospin of neutrinos and that of antineutrinos are coupled.

[Duan2013]_ decomposed the system into "normal modes" of the flavor isospin. The bipolar system is discussed in details in this paper. In a two beam model, the length of one of the perturbations can be discribed using an equation

.. math::
   \ddot {\tilde q_+} \approx - \eta (\eta + \mu) \tilde q_+,

where :math:`\eta=\pm 1` deterimines the hierarchy, :math:`\mu=2\sqrt{2}G_F \lvert \omega_0 \rvert^{-1} n_{\mathrm {tot}}`. We find out from the equation that normal hierarchy (NH, :math:`\eta=1`) doesn't have instabilities, but inverted hierarchy (IH, :math:`\eta=-1`) has instabilities with growth rate :math:`\sqrt{\mu-1}`, if :math:`\mu>1`.
