Multi-Zenith-Angle Instability
================================

Multi-zenith-angle instability was first described in a paper [Banerjee2011]_.

   :class: toggle

   System with neutrino self-interactions.

   Non-isotropic neutrino gas would have velocity (or momentum) related interactions, :math:`1-\vec v_p\cdot\vec v_q`, which is in fact a :math:`1 -\frac{2\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{3}} Y_1^0(\theta,\phi)` term.

A small anisotropy leads to a runaway flavor equipartition. [2]_

In this paper the author adds a small perturbation to a perfectly isotropic neutrino antineutrino gas. The results show multi-angle instability.

   A figure from Raffelt & Simirnov (2007) shows the instability from anisotropic small perturbations. Potential energy grows expotentially, where :math:`-E_1 = \mu/4 \vec{D_1}^2` .
