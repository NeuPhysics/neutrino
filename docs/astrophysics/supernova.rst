Supernova
===========================

One astonishing fact about core collapse supernova is that almost all (99%) of the gravitational binding energy will be transfered to neutrinos.


Neutrino Oscillations
----------------------------

In a supernova explosion, many effects come into neutrino oscillations.

0. Vacuum oscillations;
1. Matter effect:

   a. MSW;

2. Neutrino self-interaction:

   a. spectral swap;
   b. spectral split;
