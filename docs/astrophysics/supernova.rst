Supernova
===========================

One astonishing fact about core collapse supernova is that almost all (99%) of the gravitational binding energy will be transfered to neutrinos.



Features of Type II supernova from observation in astronomy are listed below [Budge]_.

1. They have asymmetic remnants,
2. The elements are not uniformly distributed in the remanants,
3. Neutron stars obtained high velocities from somewhere,
4. ...


We are most interested in neutrinos. From the view of observations, our detectors in the solar system can detect neutrino flux with energy spectrum and time evolution.



Supernova Explosion
---------------------------------


Bounce to Explode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first idea about core collapse supernova model is to facilitated the idea of bounce on the surface of proto-neutron star.

It should be notice that heat capacity is negative for a star balanced by nuclear fusion until other short range repulsive forces is comparable with grativational force.

Thus we expect a violent destiny in the end of some stars when the fusion is not suffient to fight the gravitational force leading to a runaway process. The star collapses.

However, collapse of the star is usually countered by other forces such as nuclear strong forces. When the core reaches nuclear density which is the limit of compression of nuclear materials, a bounce occurs.



But
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, the bounce alone is not enough. The shock of the explosion will stall and fall back onto the proto-neutron star. More energy should be deposited into the shock in order to revive it. Hence neutrino heating is introduced.

Numerical simulations show that simple models of neutrino heating is still not sufficient. To revive the shock, we have to develop more models.



1. Is the energy density in the shock more distributed or concentrated in small regions? This is related to **convection** and the **angular distribution of neutrinos**.
2. Do we have more electron flavor neutrinos at the shock? Electron flavor neutrinos are the primary source of neutrino energy deposition into the shock. This is related to the **neutrino flavor conversion**.
3. Numerically, neutrino transport in supernova is very hard if flavor oscillations are considered. One of the trick is to estimate the flavor conversion at different distances then implement it as a flavor profile in the simulation.



Other Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Adam Burrows et al developed a mechanism that allows protoneutron star to vibrate and explode the star [Burrows2006]_. In their model, neutrino energy deposition is not necessary.


Efforts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Budge mentioned that several directions are being explored for more successful supernova models. [Budge]_

1. Hydrodynamics,
2. Boltzmann transport,
3. General relativity corrections,
4. Neutrino physics.





Boltzmann Transport
------------------------------------







Neutrino Oscillations
----------------------------

In a supernova explosion, many effects come into neutrino oscillations.

0. Vacuum oscillations;
1. Matter effect:

   a. MSW;

2. Neutrino self-interaction:

   a. spectral swap;
   b. spectral split;
