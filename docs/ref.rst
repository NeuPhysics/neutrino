Wick C. Haxton & Barry R. Holstein wrote two good reviews of neutrino physics,

1. `Neutrino Physics <http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9905257v1>`_
2. `Neutrino Physics: an Update <http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0306282v1>`_


PDG has a complex review of neutrino mass problems

1. `NEUTRINO MASS, MIXING, AND OSCILLATIONS <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-neutrino-mixing.pdf>`_

About coherence:

1. `Coherence of Nuetrino Oscillations in The Wave Packet Approach <http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.58.017301>`_ by Giunti & Kim. They gave a simple but elegent way to calculate the decohrence.
