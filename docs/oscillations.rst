Oscillations

Evidence of Oscillations
---------------------------


A lot of experiments have been done to research on neutrino oscillations. In summary there are three types,

1. Solar neutrinos,
2. Reactor and accelerator neutrinos,
3. Atmosphere neutrinos.



Theory

The Mixing Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Neutrinos evolve in mass eigenstates. So we need to describe flavour states :math:`\ket{\nu_\alpha}` using mass eigenstates :math:`\ket{\nu_j}`.

.. math::
   \ket{\nu_\alpha} = \sum_j U^*_{\alpha j} \ket{\nu_j;\tilde p_j},

where :math:`U^*_{\alpha j}` is the element of neutrino mixing matrix.

In ultra relativistic case, we can simply find out the time evolution, which is equivalent to distance evolution,

.. math::
   \ket{\nu_\alpha(x)} = \sum_j U^*_{\alpha j} G_j(t,t_0) \ket{\nu_j;\tilde p_j}.

The survival probability is

.. math::
   P(\nu_l\to\nu_{l'}) = \left\vert \braket{\nu_{l'} }{\nu_l (t)}  \right\vert^2 .

   How would a wave packet spread?


.. admonition:: Answer
   :class: note

   A Gaussian wave packet would spread or shrink. The key of this spreading or shrinking is the dispersion relation.

   For **non-relativistic** Gaussian wave packet :math:`\psi(x,t) = e^{-\alpha(k-k_0)^2}` in momentum basis with dispersion relation :math:`\hbar\omega = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}`, the expansion of packet is

   .. math::
      \Delta x= \sqrt{\alpha^2+\left(\frac{\hbar t}{2m}\right)^2} .

   Obviously, the RMS width spreads according to group velocity :math:`v_g = \hbar _0/m`.

   **However, the situation could be different for a relativistic neutrino.**
