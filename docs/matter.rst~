MSW Effect
-------------------


.. admonition:: Physics of MSW
   :class: note

   As neutrinos passing by matter, the effective mass coming from energy change becomes important thus changing it's eigenstates and propagation.



Neutrinos do interact with matter, mostly electrons in most cases.

The one that is missing is the charged current for :math:`nu_\tau` and :math:`e^{-}` interaction because of lepton number conservation.

The first two diagrams will add two equal terms on the diagonal terms of Hamiltonian, which can be viewed as adding a number times identity matrix thus conserves the eigenstates while shifts the eigenvalues. However, the third diagram will only add a term to the first diagonal term of Hamiltonian, which is the weak coupling :math:`\Delta = \sqrt{2}G_F n(x)` with :math:`n(x)` being the number density of electrons.

.. admonition:: Weak Interaction
   :class: note

   We can guess this interaction term using physics picture. This interaction should be proportional to density of electrons with a coupling constant :math:`G_F`. Then check the dimensions.

   .. math::
      [G_F] &= [E]^{-2} \\
      [n(x)] & = [E]^3

   So the dimension is right. The missing constant is :math:`\sqrt{2}`.



This symmetry breaking will change the evolution and makes the states more electron neutrino.

This is the reason of MSW effect.

In other words, the first requirement of MSW effect is that the electrons interacts with neutrinos and makes it in a specific state that is heavy if the electron density is strong enough. Meanwhile, if the mixing angle is not that large, a level crossing could happen making the state a light state as the density becomes vacuum. The other requirement, which is obvious, is that the density change should be adiabatic, the meaning of which is the density profile of matter gently reduces to vacuum, leaving enough reaction time for the neutrinos.

The MSW effect itself can be made clear using the example of neutrino oscillations in our sun.


.. admonition:: Small Mixing Angle
   :class: note

   Take two flavour mixing as an example.

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}\nu_e \\ \nu_x\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}  \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ -\sin\theta  & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}   \begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\ \nu_2\end{pmatrix}

   In the small mixing angle limit,

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}\nu_e \\ \nu_x\end{pmatrix} \to \begin{pmatrix}  1 & \theta \\ -\theta  & 1 \end{pmatrix}   \begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\ \nu_2\end{pmatrix}

   which is very close to an identity matrix. This implies that electron neutrino is more like mass eigenstate :math:`\nu_1`. By :math:`\nu_1` we mean the state with energy :math:`\frac{ \delta m^2 }{4E}` in vacuum.

   We need this intuitive picture to understand MSW effect. Electron neutrinos are almost identical to the low mass neutrino mass eigenstate. **However, as we will see, due to the matter interaction, the electron flavour neutrino is corresponding to the HEAVY mass eigenstate.** This is the key idea in physics of MSW effect.


The Hamiltonian for neutinos with neutrino-matter interaction (in flavour basis) is

.. math::
   \mathbf H = \frac{ \delta m^2 }{4E}\begin{pmatrix} -\cos 2\theta & \sin 2\theta \\ \sin 2\theta & \cos 2\theta \end{pmatrix}  {\color{red} + \frac{\Delta}{2} \mathbf {\sigma_3}}  {\color{green}+ \Delta \mathbf I},

where the last term (green part) can be neglected because this term will only shift all the eigenvalues with the same amount without changing the eigenvectors.

Define a quantities like :math:`\omega=\frac{ \delta m^2 }{2E}` for neutrinos ( :math:`\bar\omega = \frac{ \delta m^2 }{-2E}` for antineutrinos) and :math:`\Delta = \sqrt{2} G_F n(x)` (which might be denoted by :math:`\nu = \sqrt{2}G_F n_\nu` in other lituratures).


Using Pauli matrices, I can decompose this to

.. math::
   \mathbf H = \frac{\omega}{2}= ( -\cos2\theta \sigma_3 + \sin 2\theta \sigma_1 )   {\color{red} + \frac{\Delta}{2} \mathbf {\sigma_3}}  {\color{green}+ \Delta \mathbf I}

.. note::
   As a reminder, :math:`\Delta = \sqrt{2}G_F n(x)`.


.. note::
   The red part is from the charged current Feynman diagram. We have a :math:`\mathbf\sigma_3` matrix instead of an matrix like

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}

   because we rewrite this matrix with Pauli matrices and identy. Then the identities are neglected.

   This can be done properly because Pauli matrice and Identy matrix form a complete basis.

In a more compact form, this Hamiltonian is

.. math::
   \mathbf H &= \frac{ \delta m^2 }{4E} \left( -\cos 2\theta \mathbf {\sigma_3 } + \sin 2\theta \mathbf{\sigma_1} \right)  {\color{red} + \frac{\Delta}{2} \mathbf {\sigma_3}} \\
   & = \left(\frac{\Delta}{2} -\frac{ \delta m^2 }{4E} \cos 2\theta\right) \mathbf {\sigma_3 } + \frac{ \delta m^2 }{4E} \sin 2\theta \mathbf{\sigma_1}

.. note::
   Eigenvalues of :math:`\mathbf {\sigma_3}` are 1 and -1 with corresponding eigenvectors

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}

   and

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}0\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.

As we have mentioned, this Hamiltonian is in flavour basis. When mixing angle :math:`\theta \to 0`, the eigenvectors are almost eigenvectors of :math:`\mathbf{\sigma_3}` which are electron neutrinos and x type neutrinos.


.. admonition:: Interesting Limits
   :class: note

   Before we really solve the equation of motion, some interesting limits can be shown here.

   **Interaction** :math:`\Delta` **is much larger than cacuum mixing terms.** In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes diagonalized and the neutrinos will stay on it's flavour eigenstates in the propagation.

   **Interaction** :math:`\Delta` **is much smaller than vacuum mixing terms.** The propagation reduces to vacuum case.




To see this effect quantitively, we need to diagonalize this Hamiltonian (**Can we actually diagonalize the equation of motion? NO!**). Equivalently, we can rewrite it in the basis of mass eigenstates :math:`\{\ket{\nu_L(x)}, \ket{\nu_H(x)}\}`,

.. math::
   \ket{\nu_L(x)} &= \cos\theta(x) \ket{\nu_e} - \sin\theta(x) \ket{\nu_\mu} \\
   \ket{\nu_H(x)} & =  \sin\theta(x) \ket{\nu_e} - \cos\theta(x) \ket{\nu_\mu}.

This new rotation in matrix form is

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix} \ket{\nu_L(x)} \\ \ket{\nu_H(x)} \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta(x) & -\sin\theta(x) \\ \sin\theta(x) & \cos\theta(x) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\ket{\nu_e} \\ \ket{\nu_x} \end{pmatrix} \\
   & = \mathbf{U^{-1}_x } \begin{pmatrix}\ket{\nu_e} \\ \ket{\nu_x} \end{pmatrix}

.. admonition:: Diagonalize Hamiltonian
   :class: note

   To diagonilize it, we need to multiply on both sides the rotation matrix and its inverse,

   .. math::
      \mathbf {H_{xd}} = \mathbf{U_x^{-1}} \mathbf H \mathbf {U_x}.

   The second step is to set the off diagonal elements to zero. By solving the equaions we can find the :math:`\sin 2\theta(x)` and :math:`\cos 2\theta(x)`.

   .. math::
      \mathbf{H_{xd}} &= \mathbf{U^{-1}_x} \left( A_1 \mathbf{\sigma_1} + A_3 \mathbf{\sigma_3} \right) \mathbf{ U_x } \\
      & = \begin{pmatrix} A_3\cos 2\theta(x) - A_1 \sin 2\theta(x) & A_3 \sin 2\theta(x) + A_1 \cos 2\theta(x) \\ A_3 \sin 2\theta(x) + A_1\cos 2\theta(x) &  - A_3 \cos 2\theta(x) + A_1 \sin 2\theta(x) \end{pmatrix},

   where

   .. math::
      A_3 &  = \frac{\Delta}{2} - \frac{\delta^2 m}{4E}\cos 2\theta \\
      A_1 & =  \frac{\delta^2 m}{4E} \sin 2\theta.

   Set the off-diagonal elements to zero,

   .. math::
      A_3 \sin 2\theta(x) + A_1 \cos 2\theta(x)  = 0

   So the solutions are

   .. math::
      \sin 2\theta(x) & = \frac{A_1}{\sqrt{A_1^2 + A_3^2}} \\
      \cos 2\theta(x) & = \frac{-A_3}{\sqrt{A_1^2+A_3^2}}.

   **This diagonalize the Hamiltonian LOCALLY. It's not possible to diagonalize the Hamiltonian globally if the electron number density is not a constant.**

   **The point is, for equation of motion, we have a differentiation with respect to position** :math:`x`! **So even we diagonalize the Hamiltonian, the equation of motion won't be diagonalized. An extra matrix will occur on the LHS and de-diagonalize the Hamiltonian on RHS.**


.. note::
   As :math:`\Delta \to \infty`, :math:`A_3\to \infty` and :math:`\sin 2\theta(x)` vanishes. Thus the neutrino will stay on flavour eigenstates.

With the newly defined heavy-light mass eigenstates, we can calculate the propagatioin of neutrinos, []_

.. math::
   i \hbar \partial_t \ket{\psi_x(t)} = \mathbf{Extra Matrix From LHS}\cdot \mathbf H_{xd} \ket{\psi_x(t)},

where the :math:`\mathbf{Extra Matrix From LHS}` comes from the fact that changing from flavor basis :math:`\Psi(x)` to heavy-light basis :math:`\Psi_m(x)` using :math:`\mathbf {U_m}`,

.. math::
   i\partial_x (\mathbf{U_m} \Psi_m(x)) = H ( \mathbf{U_m} \Psi_m(x) )

only returns

.. math::
   i\partial_x \Psi_m(x) = \mathbf{H_{md} } \Psi_m(x) - i \mathbf{U_m^{-1}} ( \partial_x \mathbf{U_m} ) \Psi_m(x).


We imediately know the propagation is on the heavy-light mass eigenstates under adiabatic condition WITHOUT solving the equation. The eigenvalue of these states are :math:`-\sqrt{A_3^2+A_1^2}` and :math:`\sqrt{A_3^2+A_1^2}`. The absolute value of these solutions grow as :math:`\Delta` becomes large.

Combining the two terms on RHS,

.. math::
   i\partial_x \Psi_m(x) = \mathbf{H_m} \Psi_m(x),

where

.. math::
   \mathbf{H_m} = \mathbf{H_{md}} - i \mathbf{U_m^{-1}} ( \partial_x \mathbf{ U_m } ).

The only part inside :math:`\mathbf{U_m(x)}` that is space dependent is the number density of the electrons :math:`n(x)`. **Thus we know immediately that the Hamiltonian is diagonalized if the number density is constant.**


.. admonition:: Is Adabatic Condition Valid Here?
   :class: note

   Haxton's paper.

   Before going into the system, here is a discussion of adiabatic in thermodynamics.








From the two solutions we know there is a gap between the two trajectories. We draw a figure with electron number density as the horizontal axis and energy as the vertical axis.

MSW Refraction, Resonance and More
---------------------------------------------------------


.. admonition:: Hysteresis Loops of Neutrino Oscillations Due to MSW Effect
   :class: note

   Due to MSW effect, a system that is close to adiabaticity but not exactly adiabaticity could exhibit hysteresis effect, i.e., neutrinos going from high density region to low density region then coming back could form a hysteresis loop.


TODO

1. Write down the effective potential :math:`V(x)` which depends on the position. Refractive index is defined as :math:`n_{ref} - 1 = \frac{V}{p}`.
2. Two characteristic length: :math:`l_v = \frac{4\pi E}{ \delta m^2 }` as the vacuum oscillation length and :math:`l_0=\frac{2\pi}{V}` as the refraction length. As the becomes comparable resonance occurs. For small mixing angle cases, resonance happens when vacuum length is about the length of refraction.



There are three different matrix representatioins that is useful to the calculations.

1. Flavor basis;
2. Vacuum mass eigenstate basis;
3. Instataneous mass eigenstate basis.

.. admonition:: Basis of Hamiltonian
   :class: note

   In vacuum mass eigenstate basis, the Hamiltonian without matter and self-interaction is easy and straightforward,

   .. math::
      \mathbf{H_{vmv}} = \mathbf{H_{vp}} = \frac{1}{2E}\begin{pmatrix} m_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & m_2^2 & 0  \\ 0 & 0 & m_3^2
      \end{pmatrix},

   The interaction in flavor basis is

   .. math::
      \mathbf{V} = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2}G_F n & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.

2 Flavor Solar Neutrino
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. admonition:: Solar Neutrinos
   :class: note

   Electron neutrinos are produced in the core of the sun then the neutrinos would propagate out to the surface of the sun without much difficulty. What is the predicted neutrino survival probability?


Interaction with matter plays a big role in neutrino oscillation. As shown previously, the interaction only affects (anti) electron neutrinos. In other words, the interaction term in flavor basis is

.. math::
   V_f = \begin{pmatrix} \Delta & 0 \\ 0 & 0  \end{pmatrix}.

where :math:`\Delta = \sqrt{2} G_F n` and :math:`n` is the number density of the electrons. However, to do calculations, since identity matrix doesn't change the survival probability, we can always make the hamiltonian traceless, which becomes

.. math::
   H_i=\frac{\Delta}{2} \boldsymbol{\sigma_3}.







.. admonition:: Identity Matrix and Survival Probability
   :class: note

   Identity matrix shifts the eigenvalues up and down homogeneously which changes the evolution of the state. However, since this is only a phase, the calculation of the survival probability will kill this phase.
