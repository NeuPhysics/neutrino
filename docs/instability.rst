Instability
=====================

Instability of neutrino oscillation means the rapid growth of the oscillations.

   Where do we get the perturbations?

Linear Stability Analysis

Bimodal Instability
---------------------------

Neutrino oscillatioins are synchronized but with a small amplitude inside a SN core (suppressed by matter effects),[1]_ which basically pin down the flavour transformation. As the flux reaches

MAA
--------------------------

Multi-azimuth angle (MAA) instability, first discovered by Georg Raffelt et al, in the work `Axial Symmetry Breaking in Self-Induced Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrino Fluxes <http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.091101>`_ , is an intrinsic symmetry breaking.

This instability may come from the term that is related to the velocity of neutrinos in the Hamiltonian.
