   Where do we get the perturbations?

Bimodal Instability

MAA
--------------------------

Multi-azimuth angle (MAA) instability, first discovered by Georg Raffelt et al, in the work `Axial Symmetry Breaking in Self-Induced Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrino Fluxes <http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.091101>`_ , is an intrinsic symmetry breaking.

This instability may come from the term that is related to the velocity of neutrinos in the Hamiltonian.
