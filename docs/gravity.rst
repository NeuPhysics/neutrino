Effect of Gravitition
=====================

The effect of gravitition on neutrino oscillation could be great around a neutron star.

The spacetime are distorted around the neutron star.

* Time gradient/delay; Shapiro delay;
* Space geometry/trajectory; self-interaction :math:`\vec v\cdot \vec v'`
* Redshift

Deflection in The Trajectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the trajectory of photons, we only need to find out the geodesic. Neutrinos are massive particles which are different from photons. However, the neutrinos we are considering have energy as high as several MeVs or even more while their mass are less than 1eV. In this case, they are relativistic so their trajectory are close to photons'.
