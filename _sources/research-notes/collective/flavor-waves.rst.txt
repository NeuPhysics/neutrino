Flavor Waves
======================


We have to specify the field before we can visualize the waves.


In the paper [Duan2009]_ the field is named as spin waves, which is in fact a field of rotating angles :math:`\phi(t,\mathbf x)` of the flavor isospin around the direction of vacuum Hamiltonian in mass basis in this space. It is a flavor isospin field but is characterized by this rotating angle :math:`\phi(t,\mathbf x)`.

In general, we could think of the wave as a lot of internal spins, whose direction is defined by comparing them to the local Hamiltonian. The equation of motion is first order

.. math::
   (\partial_t + \hat v \cdot \boldsymbol \nabla) \mathbf s = \mathbf s \times \mathbf H,

which is a precession equation not a wave equation. We can not think of the spin itself as wave. For a constant :math:`\mathbf H`, Fourier transform of the equation shows that

.. math::
   \omega = \mathbf k \cdot \hat v,

and :math:`\tilde{\mathbf s}` is parallel to :math:`\mathbf H` in order to have solutions.

One of the interesting things to do is to connect this view of waves to the dispersion relation.
